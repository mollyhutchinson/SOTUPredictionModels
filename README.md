# SOTUPredictionModels

Code and report written by Molly Hutchinson and Frank Wills. 

Each year of a US President’s term in office they give the State of the Union Address to
Congress, detailing information about the nation and the President’s agenda. We trained
several classifiers on a corpus of State of the Union addresses to predict the political party
affiliation of the president giving that address. Through these models we hoped to examine
whether it was possible to determine the party of a president based on their addresses and
to compare how each model performed on a generally formal corpus such as the State of
the Union address. We found promising results, with accuracies consistently well above
random chance.

In Term_Project.pdf is our 20-page report detailing our experiments and findings. 

TermProject.ipynb contains all the Python code that we did and all of our models and findings.
